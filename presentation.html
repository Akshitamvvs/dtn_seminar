    </div>
    <div class= "row " style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 100px;">
      <b> Abstract: </b>Digital Twin (DT), integrating a variety of advanced technologies together, is actively playing essential roles in manufacturing processes. As a virtual representation of physical assets, DT can be treated as the foundation of more complicated management architectures. In production, we can start with the perspectives of either method and application to realize a high-fidelity DT. In this talk, we will also discuss some of the challenges that DT technology can solve, as well as the potential of DT in the future.

    </div>
    <div class= "row " style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 100px;">
      <b> Abstract: </b>With the increase in the number of smart vehicles, there is an increase in the amount of information requested by these vheciles, with reasonable turn around time and the no loss in QoS. With traditional V2V communications, there are a lot of restrictions with respect to the amount of information that can be stored by vehicles and RSUs, communication delays and sensing ranges. This requires a different approach, which includes understanding social connections within the vehicles, refreshing the cached contents based on content popularity, while dynamically adjusting storage, and communication resources based on dynamic vehicular networks. This paper uses DTNs to model vehicular social connenctions and LSTMs and DDPG to model the vehicular cahce cloud and schedule the edge caching. </div>

      <b>Topic: </b> &nbsp;An anomaly detection framework for digital twin driven cyber-physical systems
    </div>
    <div class= "row " style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 100px;">
      <b> Abstract: </b>In recent years, the digital twin has been one of the active research areas in modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Both the digital twin and its physical counterpart, called a plant, are highly intertwined such that they continuously exchange data to reveal useful information about the overall system. Such class of CPSs needs to be robust to various types of disturbances, such as faulty sensors and model discrepancies, since the interplay between the physical plant’s operation and digital twin’s simulation may lead to undesirable or even destructive effects. To address this problem, this paper introduces a flexible anomaly detection framework for monitoring anomalous behaviors in digital twin-based CPSs. In particular, the author's approach integrates both the digital twin and data-driven techniques that detect and classify anomalous behaviors due to modeling errors (e.g. incomplete models) and sensor and physical system faults. The framework can be deployed to any general CPSs without the full knowledge of the digital twin’s internal model. Therefore, the presented method is amenable to various types of digital twin implementations that enhance the traditional data-driven anomaly detection mechanism. The authors demonstrate the performance of their approach using the Tennessee Eastman Process model. The experimental result shows this approach is able to effectively detect and classify anomaly sources from the physical plant, sensor, and digital twin, even in the situation when a certain combination of multiple anomalies occurs simultaneously.

    <div class= "row " style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 100px;">
      <b> Abstract: </b>This paper talks about how the digital twin based structural health monitoring could overcome some of major issues of Traditional Structural health monitoring system such as dependence on structural and physical expertise. Two case studies where conducted. In the first case study they created a prototype physical structure and applied some load impacts and analysed the data and provided possible predictions on its virtual counterpart by applying certain supervised deep learning algorithms. For the second case they tested on actual physical structure and it could determine current state of the structure with 92% accuracy. Major difficulty was in collecting all the required data that could be used to train the Deep learning models and update models by retraining as data being collected gets updated. Their framework works on predefined set of damages and only use vibration data.

      <b>Topic: </b> &nbsp; Graph Learning for Cognitive Digital Twins in Manufacturing Systems</div>
    <div class= "row " style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 100px;">
      <b> Abstract: </b> Manufacturing industry is expanding in a very past pace. With the amount techological advanements happening , it is not very feasible to do research on the products physically. So, to make this process easier we have to come up with some technique to create a virtual twin of the products, so that the research can be done easily and in a cost-effective way. Digital Twins has paved way to achieve this step. Digital twins have a physical twin, a digital twin, and the connection between the two. Benefits of using digital twins, especially in manufacturing, are abundant as they can increase efficiency across an entire manufacturing life cycle. The possibilities of advancements with digital twins are very high. In this paper, they try to come up with a new kind of digital twin called Cognitive digital twin to make the digital twins able to meet the requirements of industry 4.0. The cognitive digital twins must be able to incorporate fundamental aspects of cognition which includes attention, perception, memory, reasoning, learning and problem-solving. These are the pathway to Indusrty 4.0. So, Cognitive digital twins will allow indsutries to creatively, effectively, and efficiently exploit implicit knowledge drawn from the experience of existing manufacturing systems. The fundamental aspects of cognition incorporated will enable more autonomous decisions and control, while improving the performance0. This paper proposes graph learning as one potential method to enable cognitive functionalities in manufacturing digital twins. Graph learning is used because they are able to show the connections betweeen different stages of production cycle in a very easy and understandable way. </div>

      <b>Topic: Application-Driven Network-Aware Digital Twin Management in Industrial Edge Environments</b> &nbsp; </div>
    <div class= "row " style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 100px;">
      <b> Abstract: </b> The use of the Internet of Things (IoT) in industrial settings is encouraging the use of the digital twin (DT) approach, which is used at the network's edge to handle heterogeneity caused by siloed application management solutions and protocols created by various manufacturing tools and enterprise software. In this difficult environment, network heterogeneity is also a key factor that might impede the design and implementation of DT-oriented applications. The Application-driven digital twin networking middleware proposed in this paper has two goals: 1) Simplifying interoperability across diverse devices by allowing DTs to use IP-based protocols rather than specific industrial protocols, and by enriching data using well-defined standards. 2) Dynamically managing network resources in industrial edge contexts, using software defined network working to leverage the most appropriate communication channels for application requirements, ranging from native IP to more articulated dependent on packet content.</div>

      <b>Topic: </b> &nbsp; Twinbase: Open-Source Server Software for the Digital Twin Web</div>
    <div class= "row " style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 100px;">
      <b> Abstract: </b> In the future, digital twins are expected to establish a network called the "Digital Twin Web." The Digital Twin Web, like the World Wide Web, is made up of meta-level digital twins that are specified in digital twin description documents and transmitted over Digital Twin Web servers. Twinbase is an open-source, Git-based Digital Twin Web server created with the user in mind. Twinbase maintains digital twin documents in a Git repository, updates them with Git workflows, and distributes them to users via a static web server, from which they can be accessed via a client library or a web browser. Twinbase comes with a GitHub repository, Pages, and Actions, but it may be customized to work with other providers or self-hosting. This paper focuses on Twinbase's core architecture, which allows for the creation of derivative and alternative server implementations, as well as the concept of a digital twin identifier registry, which can help solve this problem because the Digital Twin Web requires permanent, globally available, and transferable IDs to function correctly.</div>

    <div class= "row " style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 100px;">
      <b> Abstract: </b> The fast expansion of motor vehicles in transportation networks gives economic wealth to our society, but it also brings with it lots of new difficulties in terms of safety, mobility, and environmental sustainability around the world. The difficult phase when you drive and get on to the highway or take exits is Ramp merging and the majority chunk of accidents happen during these maneuvers, and it is said to be chaotic in nature in both longitudinal and latitudinal driver behaviors. It is caused due to lack of cooperation\coordination. Here the authors try solving this using the Digital twin where the vehicles are connected to each other with a cloud-based communication. The typical DSRC approach is not used in this study. The digital twins process the data in real time on the servers and send the inputs to their counterparts in the real world. Three passenger automobiles were used in a real-world field implementation in Riverside, California. In comparison to the baseline scenario, where no advisory information is provided throughout the merging process, the results reveal that the suggested method addresses issues of safety and environmental sustainability with an acceptable communication latency.</div>

      <b>Topic: </b> &nbsp; Deep Reinforcement Learning for
      Flocking Motion of Multi-UAV systems: Learn from a Digital Twin </div>
    <div class= "row " style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 100px;">
      <b> Abstract: </b> - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in both military and civilian
      industries for decades. Flocking motion is a fundamental but critical operation of multi-UAV
      systems in these applications. Traditional flocking motion methods are usually tailored to a
      particular setting. The real world, on the other hand, is primarily uncertain and stochastic,
      limiting the applicability of these strategies. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is employed in
      this research to achieve the flocking motion of multi-UAV systems. Because the sim-to-real
      problem prevents DRL from being used in the flocking motion scenario, a digital twin (DT)
      enabled DRL training framework is offered as a solution. With the help of DT, the DRL model
      can learn from DT and be promptly deployed on a real-world UAV. Under this training paradigm,
      this study proposes a behavior-coupling deep deterministic policy gradient (BCDDPG)
      actor-critic DRL method for the flocking motion problem, which is inspired by animal flocking
      behavior.
      BCDDPG's performance is evaluated by extensive simulations. In comparison to existing
      approaches, simulation findings reveal that BCDDPG achieves a larger average reward and
      performs better in terms of arrival rate and collision rate.</div>

      <b>Topic: </b> &nbsp; Digital Twin – A Machine Learning Approach to Predict Individual Stress Levels in Extreme Environments</div>
    <div class= "row " style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 100px;">
      <b> Abstract: </b>It is essential to keep track of the health conditions of the personnel, given the amount of stress they are exposed to on a routine basis. In this paper, smart, washable textile is introduced, which monitors the stress levels based on various parameters such as core body temperature, humidity, heart rate, limb skin temperatures, and breath frequency using sensors integrated within the textile. As negative stress levels have an impact on health as well as influence the efficiency and productivity of the personnel, Remote Health Monitoring (RHM) plays a vital role. Based on the sensory data obtained from about 72 sensors for average 8 people, this data is represented digitally, thereby inducing the concept of the digital twin. A model is built to predict the stress levels from the data represented in digital space collected from these physical sensors. In this paper, the stress-level scale is defined with the guidance of an expert medical advisor as the already existing stress-level scales are deduced by the behavioral and appearance pattern and are not based on sensory data. To avoid continuous exposure to negative stress in real-time, a data acquisition environment is created and labeled data snapshots are collected for the modeling purpose. After implementing various modeling techniques and comparing the results of each, it is observed that the Random Forest Regressor outperforms the others.</div>

    <div class= "row " style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 100px;">
      <b> Abstract: </b>An intelligent combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) and approaches to modeling and simulation is one of the most challenging endeavors for future cities, manufacturing industries, and predictive maintenance. Digital Twins take on a unique role here. However, the question of what a Digital Twin is and what differentiates it from a regular model is still open. We present an experimental setup for integrating an existing simulation model of Hamburg's traffic system with the city's real-time sensor network. The Digital Twin is implemented using the large-scale multi-agent framework MARS. The entire process from the model description to retrieving real-time data from the IoT sensors and incorporating it in the simulation is presented. As a first prototypical example, a multi-modal mobility model was connected to real-world bike-sharing locations in Hamburg. We find that the combination of multi-agent systems and IoT sensors as a Digital Twin shows enormous potential for city planners, policy stakeholders, and other decision-makers. By correcting the course of a simulation via real-time data, the corridor of uncertainty that is intrinsic to some simulation models' use can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, any divergence of simulated and sampled data can lead to a deeper understanding of complex adaptive systems like big cities.</div>
